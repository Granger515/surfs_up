# surfs_up
An analysis of weather for a surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii for potential investors.

##Overview
The data request is divided into two parts.

###Part One - June
1. Filter the data for the daily temperature across multiple years leaving only dates in June.
2. Convert the data into a list.
3. Convert the llist into a Pandas dataframe.
4. Provide summary statistics for the dataframe.

###Part Two - December
1. Filter the data for the daily temperature across multiple years leaving only dates in December.
2. Convert the data into a list.
3. Convert the list into a Pandas dataframe.
4. Provide summary statistics for the dataframe.

##Results
The results of the two parts of the data request are as follows:

###Part One
Data filtering and organization was achieved as requested. 

The following displays the summary statistics of the first part of the analysis.

###Overall Results
1. The mean temprature in June (74.9) is slightly higher than in December (71.0).
2. The variation of temprature in December (SD = 3.7) is slightly higher than in June (SD = 3.3).
3. The minimum temperature in December (56.0) is lower than in June (64).


##Summary

While there are some variations in temperature between June and December in Hawaii the data suggests that the temperature in December should be similar enough to the temperature in June to provide some ice cream sales and demand for surfing equipment. It is likely that there will be less days in December as the average temperature is lower. However, temperature alone is not sufficient to determine if the business model is viable year-round. Precipitation would also be a factor. It is recommended that an analyses of precipitation be conducted for both months, noting both the total precipitation per month and the number of days in which significant participation occurred.
