# surfs_up
An analysis of weather for a surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii for potential investors.

##Overview
The data request is divided into two parts.

###Part One - June
1. Filter the data for the daily temperature accross multiple years leaivng only dates in June.
2. Convert the data into a list.
3. Convert the llist into a Pandas dataframe.
4. Provide summary statistics for the dataframe.

###Part Two - December
1. Filter the data for the daily temperature accross multiple years leaivng only dates in December.
2. Convert the data into a list.
3. Convert the llist into a Pandas dataframe.
4. Provide summary statistics for the dataframe.

##Results
The results of the two parts of the data request are as follows:

###Part One
Data filtering and organizatin was achieved as requested. 

The followong displays the summary statistics of the first part of the analysis.

###Overall Results
1. The mean temprature in June (74.9) is slightly higher than in December (71.0).
2. The variation of temprature in December (SD = 3.7) is slightly higher than in June (SD = 3.3).
3. The minimum temperature in December (56.0) is lower than in June (64).


##Summary
While there are some variations in temperaature between June and December in Hawaii the data sugggests that the temprature in Decemeber should be similar enough to 
the teperature in June to provide some ice cream sales and demand for surfing equipment. It is likely that there will be less days in December as the average
temperature is lower. Howevver, temperature alone is not sufficient to determine if the business model is viable year round. Percipitation would also be a factor.
It is recommended that an analyses of percipitation  be conducted for both months, noting both the total perciptation per month and the number of days in which 
significant participation occured.
